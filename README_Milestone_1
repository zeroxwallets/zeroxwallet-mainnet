# ZeroxWallet – Milestone 1 Submission

Objective
The goal of Milestone 1 was to successfully deploy and demonstrate a functional non-custodial wallet on the Hedera Testnet, showcasing core features such as account integration, transactions, and smart contract deployment.

Achievements

✅ Live Wallet Deployment on Hedera Testnet
ZeroxWallet is now operational on the Hedera Testnet with a working user interface.

✅ Core Wallet Functions

Real-time HBAR balance check using Hedera Mirror Node APIs.

Send & Receive HBAR securely through Hedera Account IDs.

Transaction History integrated within the wallet UI.

QR Code generation for seamless fund receiving.


✅ Authentication & Security
Wallet creation and storage are handled via Firebase authentication, ensuring secure storage of account credentials during testing.

✅ Smart Contract Deployment
A sample smart contract was deployed and verified on the Hedera EVM using Remix, proving integration with Hedera’s contract ecosystem.

✅ Frontend + Backend Integration

Frontend built with Next.js (UI for wallet actions).

Backend APIs integrated with Firebase Admin SDK for account handling.
